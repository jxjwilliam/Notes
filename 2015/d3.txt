------ css ------
The translate() method moves an element from its current position.

transform: translate(20px, 20px);
transform: translate(12px, 50%);
transform: translate(100px) rotate(20deg);

CSS3 transforms allow you to translate, rotate, scale, and skew elements.

A transformation is an effect that lets an element change shape, size and position.
CSS3 supports 2D and 3D transformations.
