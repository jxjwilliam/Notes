$rootScope.Scope.$destroy
--------------------------
The $destroy() is usually used by directives such as ngRepeat for managing the unrolling of the loop.

Just before a scope is destroyed, a $destroy event is broadcasted on this scope. Application code can register a $destroy event handler that will give it a chance to perform any necessary cleanup.


$rootScope properties
----------------------
. $id
. $parent
. $root


filter vs. filterFilter
-------------------------
You can inject service, factory, constant into controller, but not filter,
the reason is that when inject, these kind of service are initialized to a instance.
However, filter is a curry function, which  are used to transform template data before it is rendered within directives and expressions.

It is not initialize to a instance, need to dynamic call with certain arguments.
