------@ keygen -----
The <keygen> tag specifies a key-pair generator field used for forms.
When the form is submitted, the private key is stored locally, and the public key is sent to the server.
<form action="demo_keygen.asp" method="get">
  Username: <input type="text" name="usr_name">
  Encryption: <keygen name="security">
  <input type="submit">
</form>

------@ css3 ------
Usally, the most important CSS3 modules are:

Selectors

Backgrounds and Borders
Image Values and Replaced Content
Text Effects
2D/3D Transformations
Animations
Multiple Column Layout
User Interface

1. Animations and Transitions
There are two ways to create CSS animations. The first is very easy, it is done through animating the changes of CSS properties with the transition declaration. With transitions, you can create hover or mouse down effects, or you can trigger the animation by changing the style of an element with JavaScript. 
The second way for defining animations is a bit more complicated ¨C it involves the description of specific moments of the animation with the @keyframe rule. This allows you to have repeating animations that don¡¯t depend on user actions or JavaScript to get triggered.
2. Calculating Values With calc()

	width: calc(100% - 40px); /* Calculate the width */
	
3. Advanced Selectors
p::first-letter {}
p::first-line {}
:first-child, :last-child, :nth-child(odd) {}, :nth-child(6)
:not(:empty) {}	

.elem[data-foo=bar1]{
	background-color:#aaa;
}

.elem[data-foo^=bar]{
	background-color:#d7cb89;
}
4. Generated Content and Counters
Generated content is a powerful tool in the hands of developers, made available by the ::before and ::after pseudo elements. This feature lets you use less HTML to achieve the same layouts. This is especially beneficial in cases where you need extra box shadows or other visual elements that would require extra spans or divs.
.container span:hover::before{
	opacity:1;
}
5. Gradients
6. Webfonts
we have services like Google Fonts and typekit, which let you embed beautiful fonts by simply including a stylesheet in your page. There are even icon fonts like fontawesome, which contain pretty vector icons, instead of letters or numbers. This was all made possible by the @font-face rule, which lets you define the name, characteristics and source files for fonts, which you can later refer in your font/font-family declarations.
7. Box Sizing
8. Border Images
9. Media Queries
10. Multiple Backgrounds
11. CSS Columns
12. CSS 3D Transforms
