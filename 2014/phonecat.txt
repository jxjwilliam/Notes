To improve the organization of the app, we are making use of Angular's ngRoute module and we've moved the controllers into their own module phonecatControllers (as shown below).

For small AngularJS applications, it's common to create just one module for all of your controllers if there are just a few. As your application grows it is quite common to refactor your code into additional modules. For larger apps, you will probably want to create separate modules for each major feature of your app.

All variables defined with the : notation are extracted into the $routeParams object.

var phonecatServices = angular.module('phonecatServices', ['ngResource']);


------@ ngResource ------
phonecatServices.factory('Phone', ['$resource',
  function($resource){
    return $resource('phones/:phoneId.json', {}, {
      query: {method:'GET', params:{phoneId:'phones'}, isArray:true}
    });
  }]);

Notice how in PhoneListCtrl we replaced:

$http.get('phones/phones.json').success(function(data) {
  $scope.phones = data;
});
//with:
$scope.phones = Phone.query();

Sometimes, relying on the future object and data-binding alone is not sufficient to do everything we require, so in these cases, we can add a callback to process the server response. The PhoneDetailCtrl controller illustrates this by setting the mainImageUrl in a callback.  
$scope.phone = Phone.get({phoneId: $routeParams.phoneId}, function(phone) {
  $scope.mainImageUrl = phone.images[0];
});
