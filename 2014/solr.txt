A. Change your emails to send text/html MIME-encoded emails.
C. Change your emails to send text/enriched MIME-encoded emails.

Add all the images to the email as attachments with Content-Locations,
and make your email use the attachments rather than the images on the
website.


original media files (PDF files, images,Word documents, and the like) are served directly off disk. 
 Use file wrappers to write the media files out to a \\server\share network share.
 Use NFS to mount the disks from the web servers directly onto the admin server. Have the admin server write to each of the NFS mounts in turn.
 
 File wrappers (fopen, file_get_contents), and CURL extension.

 What will the following script output?

<?php
$a = 1;
$a = $a¡ª + 1;
echo $a;
?>

A. 2
Answer A is correct.The expression $a¡ª will be evaluated after the expression $a = $a + 1 but before the assignment.Therefore, by the time $a + 1 is assigned to
$a, the increment will simply be lost.

B. If the object contains resource variables, use magic functions to restore the resources upon unserialization.
C. Use the magic functions to only save what is necessary.

Whenever you design an object that is meant to be serialized or that can contain resource objects, you should implement the appropriate magic 
functions to ensure that it is serialized and unserialized properly¡ªand using the smallest amount of information possible.

When an expiration date is given in a Set-Cookie header, what is the resulting behavior in subsequent requests?

A. If the expiration date has expired, the cookie is not included.
B. The behavior is the same; the expiration date is included in the Cookie header, and you can access this information in the $_COOKIE superglobal
array.
C. The cookie persists in memory until the browser is closed.
D. The cookie is deleted and therefore not included in subsequent requests.

Answer A is correct. Answer B is incorrect because only the name and value of the
cookie are included in the Cookie header. Answer C is incorrect because setting
an expiration date causes a cookie to either be deleted (if the date has expired) or
written to disk. Answer D is incorrect because the cookie is only deleted if the
date has expired, which isn¡¯t necessarily the case.


If you set a cookie with either setcookie() or header(), you can immediately

check to see whether the client accepted it.

A. True, you can check the $_COOKIE superglobal array to see if it contains the  value you set.
B. True, but only if register_globals is enabled.
C. False, you can only use setcookie() if you need to test for acceptance. Using header() does not work.
D. False, you must wait until you receive another HTTP request to determine whether it includes the Cookie header.

Answer D is correct.The response that contains the Set-Cookie header is not sent until PHP finishes executing, so you cannot test for acceptance 
prior to this.
------@ PHP interview: http://www.pcds.co.in/php-objective-questions-60.php ------

Answers A and B are incorrect because the answer is false. Answer C is incorrect because using setcookie() and header() both result in the same thing: 
A Set-Cookie header is included in the response.

Many sites like to keep in touch with their customers via a weekly newsletter.

Many customers only come back to the website because there was something of

interest to them in the newsletter. Being able to send newsletters¡ªand being able

to make those newsletters look professional¡ªis an important feature.

Your CMS doesn¡¯t support the concept of newsletters per se. But it does support

the idea of packaging groups of files for downloading. If you could write a userdefined

file wrapper that makes a MIME email look just like a ZIP file, it would

then be very easy to add newsletter support.

Sketch out a design for a file wrapper, which would allow a PHP script to add

content, graphics, and other attachments to a MIME email.

First of all, you need to ensure that the query is

secure; this is done by executing addslashes (or the equivalent function for your

DBMS of choice) to prevent scripting attacks. If your query is long, it¡¯s not a bad

idea to split it over several lines to get a better overview of your code. Use

sprintf() where possible to make the code cleaner. Finally it¡¯s always a good idea

to define the table fields that will be filled by an INSERT statement to prevent

unexpected errors if the table changes.


////////////
You developed a big application accessed by several thousand users at the same

time. Suddenly, your web server stops responding and users are getting connection

errors.What could have happened?
B. The web server was misconfigured so that it ran into virtual memory usage

and consequent resource starvation because of too many child processes.

Although it could be possible that the database server was

killed because of the many requests from the users, they should at least be able to

see the HTML pages from the website because the web server would still be running.

If connections are timing out, it is likely that the server ran into swap space

because of misconfiguration of the number of concurrent web server child

processes and crashed because of resource starvation.

Ask your candidate to recommend some additional solutions to speed up Drupal's caching. These could include the Boost module, Varnish, Squid, Memcache or Pressflow.
