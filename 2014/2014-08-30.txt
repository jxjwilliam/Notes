- Difference between window.onload and onDocumentReady?
The onload event does not fire until every last piece of the page is loaded, this includes css and images, which means there¡¯s a huge delay before any code is executed.
That isnt what we want. We just want to wait until the DOM is loaded and is able to be manipulated. onDocumentReady allows the programmer to do that.

- When onLoad and onunload events are used in javascript?
The onload and onunload events are triggered when the user enters or leaves the page.
The onload event can be used to check the visitor's browser type and browser version, and load the proper version of the web page based on the information.
The onload and onunload events can be used to deal with cookies.


- How can you find the size of a window?
Three different properties can be used to determine the size of the browser window (the browser viewport, NOT including toolbars and scrollbars). 
For Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari:
window.innerHeight - the inner height of the browser window
window.innerWidth - the inner width of the browser window
