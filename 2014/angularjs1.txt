
Can an HTML page have multiple ¡°ng-app¡± directive for bootstrapping multiple AngularJS application?
Ans: Yes

With more than one ng-app in an HTML document (an HTML page), are they automatically initialized? Describe the angularJS application 
initialization process with multiple ng-app in an HTML document/page.
Ans: Only one AngularJS application can be auto-bootstrapped. The first ¡®ng-app¡¯ found in the document will be used to define the root element 
to auto-bootstrap as an application. To run multiple applications in an HTML document, one must manually bootstrap them using angular bootstrap service.

Can angular applications (ng-app) be nested within each other?
Ans: No

What are various possible prefixes such as ¡°ng-¡± using which Angular directives (for example, ng-app) can be defined?
Ans: ¡°ng-¡±, ¡°data-ng-¡±, ¡°ng:¡±, ¡°x-ng-¡±

What angular function is used to manually start up an angular application?
Ans: angular.bootstrap

Does Angular use the jQuery library?
Yes, Angular can use jQuery if it's present in your app when the application is being bootstrapped. If jQuery is not present in your script path, Angular falls back to its own implementation of the subset of jQuery that we call jQLite.


- What's Angular's performance like?
The startup time heavily depends on your network connection, state of the cache, browser used and available hardware, but typically we measure bootstrap time in tens or hundreds of milliseconds.
The runtime performance will vary depending on the number and complexity of bindings on the page as well as the speed of your backend (for apps that fetch data from the backend). Just for an illustration we typically build snappy apps with hundreds or thousands of active bindings.
