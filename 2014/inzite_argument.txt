At the beginning of this October, Jaiten and I discussed for the processing. At that time, there were 2 ways to do the development:
(1) follow the agreement to roughly implement all the stuff, so at the conference there would be all stuff put in the site.  such as integrate Strip, webRTC functionality into Inzite.io
(2) dig in details, instead of extending extra functionality such as WebRTC, Stripe etc.
Because many new stuff were introduced and the site need to be fixed in details.
such as: 
more accurate categories implementation, fix the vague concepts of category, industry, sector. 
. expertise details implementation
. inzite_url, auto-matched with username change and improvement
. linked grap data
. local expert data access and storage.
. switch user profile and expert profile in a better way.
. the conflict of different resource merges(local, facebook, linkedin): such as firstname, lastname, user, username.
. etc.
A lot of new stuff need to be added and vogue concepts  need to be clarified.

Jaiten told me that you said to let user put their profiles is more important, so change the schedule to focus on plan 2. 

I told Jaiten that this will change the agreement schedule and cause the project can't finish by the end of Nov.
Jaiten said you said that's ok, to make user input their profiles is more urgent, and latter you will pay me for extra implementation.


So I focus on the details on plan 2 to make the user add their profiles into the side.

Since it was your decision to change the plan, You know everything about it, so why you charge me following the agreement? It is weired.

Since you already terminated the agreement with me at the beginning of Nov, so I have the right not reply to you. So don't email me directly, contact Jaiten first to clarify everything.
