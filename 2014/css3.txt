1. Some of the most important CSS3 modules are:

Selectors
Box Model
Backgrounds and Borders
Image Values and Replaced Content
Text Effects
2D/3D Transformations
Animations
Multiple Column Layout
User Interface

2. CSS3 Borders
With CSS3, you can create rounded borders, add shadow to boxes, and use an image as a border - without using a design program, like Photoshop.

border-radius: 25px;
box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;

-webkit-border-image:url(border.png) 30 30 round; /* Safari 5 */
-o-border-image:url(border.png) 30 30 round; /* Opera 10.5-12.1 */
border-image:url(border.png) 30 30 round;

3. CSS3 Backgrounds
div {
	background:url(img_tree.gif),url(img_flwr.gif);
	background:url(img_flwr.gif);
	background-repeat:no-repeat;
	background-size:100% 100%;
	background-origin:content-box;
}
background-clip: border-box|padding-box|content-box|initial|inherit;
The background image can be placed within the content-box, padding-box, or border-box area.

4.CSS3 defines two types of gradients:

- Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally)
- Radial Gradients (defined by their center)
#grad
{
	background: -webkit-linear-gradient(red, blue); /* For Safari 5.1 to 6.0 */
	background: -o-linear-gradient(red, blue); /* For Opera 11.1 to 12.0 */
	background: -moz-linear-gradient(red, blue); /* For Firefox 3.6 to 15 */
	background: linear-gradient(red, blue); /* Standard syntax */
}

5. CSS3 Text Effects
- text-shadow: 5px 5px 5px #FF0000;
- word-wrap:break-word;
the word-wrap property allows you to force the text to wrap - even if it means splitting it in the middle of a word.


6. CSS3 Web Fonts - The @font-face Rule
Web fonts allow Web designers to use fonts that are not installed on the user's computer.

When you have found/bought the font you wish to use, just include the font file on your web server, and it will be automatically downloaded to the user when needed.

<style> 
@font-face{
	font-family: myFirstFont;
	src: url(sansation_light.woff);
	font-weight/font-stretch/font-style/unicode-range
}
div{
	font-family:myFirstFont;
}
</style>

7. CSS3 Transforms
With CSS3 transform, we can move, scale, turn, spin, and stretch elements.
A transformation is an effect that lets an element change shape, size and position.
You can transform your elements using 2D or 3D transformation.
- translate(x,y), translateX(n), translateY(n)
- rotate()
- scale()
- skew(x-angle,y-angle), skewX(angle), skewY(angle)
- matrix(n,n,n,n,n,n)

The transform-origin property allows you to change the position on transformed elements.

8. CSS3 3D Transforms
CSS3 allows you to format your elements using 3D transforms.


9. CSS3 Transitions
With CSS3, we can add an effect when changing from one style to another, without using Flash animations or JavaScripts.

Specify the CSS property you want to add an effect to
Specify the duration of the effect.

div{
	-webkit-transition: width 2s; /* For Safari 3.1 to 6.0 */
	transition: width 2s;
}
div:hover {
	width:300px;
}

10. CSS3 Animations
To create animations in CSS3, you will have to learn about the @keyframes rule.
An animation is an effect that lets an element gradually change from one style to another.

You can change as many styles you want, as many times you want.

Specify when the change will happen in percent, or the keywords "from" and "to", which is the same as 0% and 100%.

0% is the beginning of the animation, 100% is when the animation is complete.

For best browser support, you should always define both the 0% and the 100% selectors.


11. CSS3 Multiple Columns
column-count
column-gap
column-rule


12. User Interface
In CSS3, some of the new user interface features are resizing elements, box sizing, and outlining.

resize:both; overflow:auto;
box-sizing:border-box; //Specify two bordered boxes side by side:
outline-offset

box-sizing: content-box|border-box|initial|inherit:
The box-sizing property allows you to define certain elements to fit an area in a certain way:


The <section> tag defines sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document.


The <article> tag specifies independent, self-contained content.

An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the site.
