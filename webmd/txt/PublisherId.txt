Below mentioned two urls are not correct as these should be brandcast urls and not brandfeed.
Brandfeed Desktop: http://www.webmd.com/brandfeed?prx_t=SacBAzDgCAfYcLA 
Brandfeed Mobile: http://www.m.webmd.com/brandfeed?prx_t=SacBAzDgCAfYcLA
This is the structure of Brandfeed urls:
Desktop: http://www.webmd.com/brandfeed?prx_adp=6617_3038
Mobile: http://www.m.webmd.com/brandfeed?prx_adp=6617_3105
prx_advertiser_publisher
3038 is desktop
3015 is mobile

Advertisers keep changing.

So I think the two urls are not correct format.
