Why we need Chapter?

Because of Advertisement. Advertisement, or Advertisements(Ad Break) divide a video into different piece. So a full video is separated into serveral chapters to cater this case.

I seeked the document and demo carefully, to make sure there is no mistake. Probably there is a common mistake about it.

Chapter always come with Ad. A Ad breaks a Video, so a video divides into chapters to reflect the case. Otherwise we don't need Chapters.

A Ad breaks a video into chapters. In Adobe demo, an Ad is in the middle of a Video, so the video is separated into 2 chapters: 1 in front of the ad, 1 after it.

This is Adobe Analysis define Chapter and Advertisement.

(1) Video
(2) Video + Ad
(3) Video + Ad + Chapters
(4) Video + Ad + Chapters + QoE

There is no nessary for the following:
Video + Chapters


Chapters always come with Ad.
In what case we need a Chapters?
The example I have (17 chapters) seem testing purpose, no meanlingful.


https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/appmeasurement/hbvideo/video.pdf:
Video Chapters: Video chapters measurement is used for the measurement of chapters. A chapter is a sub-division of
content within a single video.


What Demo say?

------ Player event: VIDEO_LOAD ------
------ Player event: PLAY ------
------ Player event: CHAPTER_START ------
------ Player event: CHAPTER_COMPLETE ------
------ Player event: AD_START ------
------ Player event: AD_COMPLETE ------
------ Player event: CHAPTER_START ------
------ Player event: PAUSE ------
------ Player event: CHAPTER_COMPLETE ------
------ Player event: COMPLETE ------
------ Player event: VIDEO_UNLOAD ------
The completion of the content has been tracked.


///////////////////////////////

The custom metadata set on the AdobeAnalyticsPlugin is persistent. It is not
reset automatically by the video heartbeat library. To clear the custom metadata, you can pass NULL as the input argument
for each of the set...Metadata() methods. For example, you should do this for ads and chapters once they are complete.
Otherwise, the custom metadata will be applied to subsequent ads / chapters. It is your responsibility to ensure that the
appropriate metadata is set before the trackVideoLoad() / trackAdStart() / trackChapterStart() call.


You need to set the metadata prior to calling the relevant track...() method on the VideoPlayerPlugin, as follows:
• Set the video metadata before calling trackVideoLoad()
• Set the ad metadata before calling trackAdStart()
• Set the chapter metadata before calling trackChapterStart()

This will ensure that the metadata is taken into consideration by the video heartbeat library when processing the track...() call.

The 2 dynamic data are important for Adobe Aanalysis, in theory, they vary when every 10 seconds xhr call happens.
I don't know your dev env, for me, I worked in perf env, capture Chapters and apply to heartbeat chapterInfo onject.
However, I don't think the example I have is a suitable one.
