Header-bidding target: letting multiple demand sources bid on the same inventory at the same time, publishers increase their yield and make more money.


(1) using DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP) as the Ad Server.
https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?

googletag, googletag.cmd = [ callback, calllbackProxy ]

(2) Place Media.net Ad Tag in webpage.
So in query-string, it will have keys  mnet, mnetDoc etc

defineAd({ targets: {} });


(3) Each time an impression arrives, the Media.net Ad Tag sends bid requests for each and every ad slot on your page to multiple external partners such as AppNexus, Amazon A9, OpenX, pubMatic, etc., and also other demand partners of the publisher.

(4) These bids are compared in the Media.net Mediation Layer.

window.rtbsBidA = (typeof window.rtbsBidA  === 'object' ) ? window.rtbsBidA : {};

(5) Once the partners have sent their respective bid responses, the best price is chosen in a fair auction designed to further increase competition among partners.

(6) Eventually this bid and a few other parameters in the form of key value pairs are sent to DFP to activate the right line item.

callbackProxy([{"/8668145/consumer/webmd/hp-conwbmd": ....}]);


(7) DFP chooses the best line item through the Dynamic Price allocation algorithm and in-turn serves the creative on your page.

google DFP,  yahoo media.net

DFP is a platform to sell Ads directly to individual advertisers.

Media.net is a contextual ad network.


Adsense and Yahoo! Bing Network Contextual Ads are different platforms. They both have different purposes. Adsense is managed by google and its not connected in any way with Yahoo! Bing Network Contextual Ads
So you wont be able to manage adsense and Yahoo! Bing Network Contextual Ads on DFP.
