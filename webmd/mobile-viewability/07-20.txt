Prefetching, preloading and prerendering best practices:
When to use prefetching(dns):

When you're making AJAX requests to a domain other than the one you're on. This includes subdomains.
When you're dynamically rendering content on a page from a different domain. Example cases include generated links/buttons and lazyloading images.
When not to use prefetching(dns):

When there's a link on your page(Modern browsers should fetch that automatically for you)
In most cases really. Because of automatic prefetching it's hard to find cases when you'd need it other than dynamically-generated subdomains or something similar.
When to use preloading:

When you have different stylesheets for different pages and know a visitor is likely to visit another page.
When you know a visitor is likely to visit a "next page" with lots of images or other large files.
When you have a javascript MVC site and want to hint to the browser to download assets that aren't in the current view.
When not to use preloading:

When the asset is referred to somewhere else on the same page.
When you're not sure the user will actually require that asset. Like on a page visitors only go to 3% of the time.
When to use prerendering:

When you're certain that a user is going to visit a page and
When that pages has lots of assets that take a while to load.
When there's a "next page" that's very likely to be visited such as in a sign-up flow or the first link in a series of search results.
When an increase in page load speed would dramatically increase conversions.
When not to use prerendering:

When a user is not likely to visit a page.
When the amount of network data is limited(you don't want users to pay for pages they don't even visit).

You should never use a display:none element as a waypoint. This includes elements that gain display:none at any time in the lifetime of your page, as trigger points are recalculated whenever a refresh occurs, such as a window resize event.
