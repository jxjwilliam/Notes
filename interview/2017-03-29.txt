// React:

1. The Virtual DOM is not a simple Object – it is a recursive structure. 
What we get is a nested Object-tree:
{
    "type":"div",
    "key":null,
    "ref":null,
    "props":{
        "children": [
            {"type":"span","key":null,"ref":null,"props":{}},
            {"type":"button","key":null,"ref":null,"props":{}}
        ]
    }
}

This is why, in a React Component’s code, we can access the child and ancestor elements via this.props.children. What React does is to walk down a very deep tree of nested Objects, each sitting in their parent element’s children.
