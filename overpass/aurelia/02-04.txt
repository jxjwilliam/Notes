One big difference I see here is that activate method has a Promis as return value so you can run here async code. Triggering async code in constructor is a very bad idea. Further detail is that constructor must not throw an exception so typically here you just assign constructor parameters to local variables without any logic. I would not do more stuff in constructor and the actual viewmodel initialization with logic should happen in activate or attached method.

1. Try to use ES6 array 
2. $ jspm install lodash
   $ jspm install npm:lodash.map
3. import map from 'lodash/map';
let result = map(...)

propertyObserver observes a specific property (eg firstName) and notifies you when the property changes. expressionObserver observes an entire expression (eg foo.bar[x][baz].hello() * test / something) and notifies you when the result of the expression changes.
