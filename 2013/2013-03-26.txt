The Exceptions:
=============
(.) User does not exist

(.) User does exist, but vague or multiple.

(.) User records are multiple, e.g.: there are more than 1 contacts for March due to DB reason. (the data might be not always correct)

(.) StartDate/Enddate is not the format of yyyy-mm-dd: 2013/3/5

(.) StartDate/Enddate is the format of yyyy-mm-dd, but 
*NOT* leading zeros require for single digit day or month: 2013-3-5

(.) Enddate - StartDate is *NOT* correct.
EndData: 2013-04-01, StartDate: 2013-04-01
EndData: 2013-03-01, StartDate: 2013-04-01
EndData: 2013-01-04, StartDate: 2013-04-01

(.) When *NO* StartDate/EndDate, default is current Month?

(.) If no record in DB, does need a notice?
e.g. for user 'UserA', 'UserB' in April:
UserA has 0 count in April, UserB no record in April, What't the difference? 
A notice for ETL data upgrated?

(.) What's the difference of the contact number for 'Single Agent' and 'Team Member'?

(.) What is accountId? The difference between accountID and userID?
If User Loginname is used, the special character? like:
O'Neal
Mac-Donald
"Double quote"
\backspact

(.) For:
Make sure all the results of the API match the values the user would see in TPO 
(or log a defect if the TPO value is determined to be incorrect)
=================================================================================
How to do the test? Does it need to check in real-time?


(.) For the past 6 months, the returns are by monthly or by total? something like:
{ 'user': 'user',
  'MonthlyContacts': [ 
  {'2013-03': 60},
  {'2013-02': 55},
  {'2013-01': 52},
  {'2012-12': 40},
  {'2012-11': 41},
  {'2012-10': 48},
  ],
}


(.) for touchpoints, 'call' or 'appointment' is fine; for default, 
types='call' or 'appointment' return in an array or hash?
The returns like:
Returns {
“user”: “<user>”,
“startDate”: “<startDate>”,
“endDate”: “<endDate>”,
[ {“types”: “call”, “count”: “28”,}, 
  {“types”: appointment,“count”: “56”}
]}

(.) All the data in goal setting looks like 'READONLY' property, if user changes
his/her goals/data, how quickly the service reflect this changes? Any notices when display?

(.) Do we need an interface to check TP MSSQL directly to have the data comparison or data consitency?

(.) For the half year touchpoints retrieving, is there a way to distinguish this case, so no need to input
StartDate, Enddate to let customer to calculate?

(.) yearToDate or yearToMonth?


Others:
=======
(.) Currently the retrieving is all by *DATE* range, Does it the need to list
by AREA or Price? (Same Restful retrieving, different find_method).

(.) For the Transactions and Closed Listing, we have RestFul retrieving for Buyer, we seem also need for Seller:
In TP, the number of transaction = the number of closings with closed/paid status where agent represents the buyer (or buyer and seller) 
In TP, the number of closed listings = the number of closings with closed/paid status where agent represents the seller (or buyer and seller)
