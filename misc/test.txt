1. karma + jasmine : mocha + chai

So, if you were to choose a test framework setup today, what might it look like?

If you go with Jasmine, you will likely use:

- Karma (for the test runner)
- Sinon (possibly for its fake server unless your framework provides an equivalent, like $httpBackend if you are using Angular)


If you go with Mocha, you will likely use:

- Chai (for assertions)
- Sinon (for test doubles and its fake server)
- Karma or mocha CLI (for the test runner)


2. karma + es6
